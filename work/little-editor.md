### Overview
My Little Editor is a tool for editing and previewing simple HTML markup. **Key feature:** Raw text can be edited and preview window will automatically display the rendered HTML.

<img class="prj-img" src="{{project_thumbnail_color}}" alt="{{thumbnail_alt}}">
<figcaption class="fig-caption">‚Üë A caption for my project.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Purpose & Goal
The Little Editor is a project I designed and developed when I first started learning about the DOM and event handlers. The idea for this project came about because I wanted to create a tool for my hard coded website that would let me write and export short notes or posts. I also wanted to reinforce my understanding of browser events and event handlers, so I knew I'd be developing this tool from scratch to really exercise my DOM manipulation skills.

<img class="prj-img" src="{{project_thumbnail_color}}" alt="{{thumbnail_alt}}">
<figcaption class="fig-caption">‚Üë A caption for my project.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Thought process 
This project was a good way for me to get some practical experience with some simple yet powerful DOM navigation methods and properties. To make the user experience as frictionless as possible, I decided to focus on building a tool that was as intuitive as any other text editor (like WordPress)--albeit on a much smaller scale.

I had a persisting problem in which the rendering window omitted the last character from the text output. I relied on Firefox dev tools to debug the source of the problem: the key event before value assigned. I also experienced noticeable rendering delays, which created a clunky user experience. Improving the performance of the rendering output was a matter of refactoring my code and trying other DOM creation methods. 
### Takeaways
I learned quite a bit while developing this tool. I learned the hard way that defining a project's scope is crucial to the development process, no matter how simple the initial idea seems; it's quite easy to let a project run away from you if you're making it up as you go. On a technical level, I gained a lot of insight into how the browser interprets events.
