<p class="about"> Hi there! My name's Christina and I am a front-end web developer. </p>
<p class="about">I taught myself HTML and CSS after I got my first laptop in my freshman year of college. What started as a hobby grew into a part-time job updating e-courses for my university. Then a web start-up took me on as a tech support specialist where I plunged headfirst into the tech ecosystem that is the SaaS industry. </p>
<p class="about"> Once I started interfacing directly with users and developers, my assumptions about web technology really began to evolve. I learned how to manage site performance, examine user navigation patterns, troubleshoot across multiple environments, integrate with 3rd party apps using API tools, and the realities and implications of supporting legacy software. There was so much nuance within web technology than I'd ever realized, and my interest in the life cycle of software development deepened. Meanwhile, the company scaled up. And one day, I just decided that being a go-between for devs and users wasn't enough for me anymore. I wanted to be the developer! </p>
<p class="about">I started small: I built a website. Then I started building small interactive web apps in Javascript. I've since designed and developed several JS based web apps, including my most robust creation, [insert completed project here]. Currently, I'm learning about React hooks and my project [insert react project description] features {cool feature]}.</p>
<p class="about"> My experience advocating for the user while acting as an intermediary for devs has certainly informed the kind of developer I want to be now: focused on inclusive UXs and invested in the full development lifecycle. In the future, I'd like to work with/on [insert project] and build things in Node.js.</p>
<p class="about"> When I'm not trying to apply JS concepts to real life applications, you can find me updating my Letterboxd.</p>
